    <h3>About Ikon & Priya</h3>

    <p class="double-space aboutme"> Hello! I'm Priya K Maharban, a full stack web developer with a rich background in technology, leadership, and customer service. I developed ikon using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses images from Unsplash via an external API. <br><br>
        As for myself, my journey in technology began in my youth, where I cultivated a deep interest by self-teaching various Adobe programs. 
        This passion for technology was further ignited during my college years, where I delved into coding and realized it was more than just an interestâ€”it was my calling. <br> I've embraced web development with fervor, eager to blend my creative and technical prowess. My skill set includes full stack web development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Django, React, React Native, graphic design, and video editing. 
        <br> I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities in web development, open to both remote and onsite roles in the New York City area. My goal is to join a team where I can contribute to groundbreaking projects and continue my growth in this vibrant industry. 
        If you're excited about collaborating on innovative web development projects and believe I'd be a great fit for your team, please feel free to reach out. For my email, check out the Contact section of this website or on my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to work together.</p>
